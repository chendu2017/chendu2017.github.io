----------

###### **Welcome to my page!**      
I am a PhD student in Operations Management at Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technological University Singapore. 
It is my honor to be advised by Professor [Geoffrey A. Chua](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00581). 
Prior to my PhD, I worked as an Operations Research Algorithm Engineer at DAMO Academy, the research institute of Alibaba Group.
I received my Master's degree in Management Science from [Antai College of Economics and Management](http://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/en/),
Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I was advised by Professor
[Huan Zheng](http://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/en/faculty/zhenghuan.html).


My research focuses on privacy-preserving analytics under the **differential privacy** framework.
I aim to design privacy-aware optimization algorithms with provable performance guarantees to balance data privacy and utility.
I am also interested in applications of these methods in machine learning, revenue management, and supply chain management.

#### **News**  
- **2025 June**, I will present my work on *Joint Differential Privacy for Resource Allocation* at EURO 2025 in Leeds and MSOM 2025 in London in late June. See you around in Leeds and London.
