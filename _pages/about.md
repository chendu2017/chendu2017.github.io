###### **Welcome to my page!**      
I am a fifth-year PhD student in Operations Management at Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technological University Singapore. 
It is my honor to work with Professor [Geoffrey A. Chua](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00581). 
Prior to PhD, I worked as an Operations Research Algorithm Engineer at DAMO Academy, the research institute of Alibaba Group.
I received my Master's degree in Management Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I was advised by Professor
[Huan Zheng](http://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/en/faculty/zhenghuan.html).


My research sits at the intersection of business operations and data privacy, aiming to combine decision-making with differential privacy to enable privacy-aware operations. I am particularly interested in designing optimization algorithms that simultaneously protect sensitive data and deliver high-quality decisions.
 I also investigate applications of these approaches in machine learning, revenue management, supply chains, and public policy.
